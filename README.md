# 2nd-Year-C-and-SQL-project
Here is a project I worked on in a team. I was tasked with  creating the entire database and it's functions. I did most of the back end, anything that had any corralation between the program and the database I coded (This includes all the SQL functions and CRUD operations) . My team members were tasked with creating the form UI and handling text from the .txt file for login purposes. 
The entire DataHandler.cs was from my side, and anything in the Database folder.
